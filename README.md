##How it was designed:  
  - We thought about how to store all the information  
  - Compared and contrasted ideas for data structures  
  - Our team settled upon vector of maps  
  - The reason why we chose this data structure is because it allows  
    flexibility and gives us direct association between team number and score.  
  
##Design Pattern:
  - For our design pattern we went with a facade design pattern. Our class  
    'CScoreboard' is inherited from 'IScoreboard.'
  - We went with a adapter design pattern because we repurposed c++ vectors and c++ maps to 'adapt' to our use case.
